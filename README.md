## UrbanNest - ecommerce website

## This is my final project for the Front-end Development academy at Change Academy.

## The project is built using: 
- JavaScript,
- React.js (with Vite), 
- Zustand for state management and local authentication, 
- Tailwind CSS for styling,
- React Router for routing,
- API requests using the Fetch API (Reference: https://fakestoreapi.com/docs),
- GitHub for version control.

## The project is deployed on Netlify. (https://urban-nest-e-store.netlify.app/)

## Key features of the application:

**• UI/UX Design** following the Figma Design
**• Login/SignUp page** using Zustand (and local storage)
**• Home Page** linked to:
    - Product Page
    - Product Listing Page
    - Account Page
    - Cart (Checkout Page) with Checkout Process pages (Checkout Details Page and Order Complete Page)
**• Product Listing Page:** Displays all products from the Fake Store API by category.
